    "The result of the DCT is also an 8 by 8 block where the first coefficient at the top left corner represents the DC coefficient. Remaining coefficients are called AC coefficients. The advantage of the DCT is its tendency to aggregate most of the signal in top left corner of the result. Note that the higher the coefficient, the more information it contains, useful to properly reconstruct the image. Thus, we can gain in storage by removing smaller coefficients which is the goal of next step."
